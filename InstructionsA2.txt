Basic Instructions:

Utilized IntelliJ to supply two executable .jar files. Once you have either 
pulled or downloaded the zip(my favourite). To use the program(s) execute the
 "server" jar first and then the "client" jar. 

As with Assignment 1, once you've launched both the server and the client and 
have time to appreciate the beauty of the masterfully crafted UI you'll notice 
that two separate windows have appeared before you;

	- The Server stage:
		- A masterclass button labelled "Kill Me" which will "kill" the server
		- If close requested (onCloseRequested) the server will also be terminated
		- This stage is ran on a different thread than the core functionality 
		- While totally unnecessary, this ensures that no mishaps occur with leaving
		the server running in the background. 
		
	- The Client stage:
		- The two main buttons, "Upload", "Download" -- up and down, get it? Get it????
		- Anchored to the right will be a "Refresh" button which will close and reopen
		the stage
		- The two tables, "Local Files", "Server Files" which contain the core 
		of assignment (files stored locally* and the "server files").
		- At the bottom of the program are the two buttons Choose Dir.. and Exit
			- *Choose Dir will allow the user to select a new directory 
			and populate the table with only .txt and .csv files contained within
			the selected directory. 
		- Exit simply exits the program.
		- Below these two buttons are an uneditable textfield which will be filled upon
		selecting a new directory.
		
		
		** The initial directory merely contains a few files to initally populate the table
		in case you neglect my hardwork in developing a Choose Dir button and just want
		the basic functionality. **
		
		
		
		
TL;DR:

1. Get Repo
2. DClick Server
3. DClick Client
4. Get files as necessary, move to server etc
5. Change directory if needed and follow previous step
6. Hit Exit on Client and "Kill Me" on the Server (or vice versa)
7. Go on with your life
